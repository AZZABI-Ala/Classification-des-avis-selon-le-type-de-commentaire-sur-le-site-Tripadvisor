# Classification of user reviews on the tripadvisor website
This project involves applying machine learning techniques to analyze and classify user comments (on the TripAdvisor website) according to the advice given. For machine learning, I used the Artificial Neural Network (ANN). If the opinion given is an opinion on a hotel, the final result of the algorithm is: class hotel, if the given opinion is an opinion on a restaurant the result is: class restaurant.
